# Branding Blackness - ACAM 320 Final Multimedia Project

This creative website's purpose is to demonstrate a critical reflection and engagement with Simone Browne's "Branding Blackness" Chapter in "Dark Matters:
On the Surveillance of Blackness" and expand Browne's work into the modern digital era.

The centerpiece of the statement is an interactive particle animation of an abstract facial figure.
The piece draws inspiration from visual algorithmic patterns in facial recognition and biometric technology.
Upon hovering along the outlines, the animation renders focused components surrounding the facial figure, representing algorithmic patterns used in technologies to identify, classify, and subjugate individuals for processing and analysis.

In addition to the figure, included is a project statement and summaries of a collection of recent news events involving racial discrimination in biometrics that exemplify the precedence of modern day surveillance and technology and its precautious effects on subjugated bodies â€” Not only in policing but also in the pursuit of corporate exploitation.

### Please view on full-screen desktop browsers in order to render the animation and timeline.
